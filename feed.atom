      I used to conceptualize learning as a rigid progression from inchoate concepts floating around in my head (visual: crazy heap indirection) to some deeper understanding, organized and schematized with all my other knowledge (visual: neat C-style enum representation).

      The messy/neat bifurcation is <a href="https://klr.tumblr.com/post/154784481858/messy-thought-neat-thought">hardly new</a>, especially when it comes to note-taking. But recently I’ve noticed some inadequacies of this framing, with interesting metacognitive implications.

      Realization #1: Sometimes the messy notes are more useful
    </h3>
<div class="text" id="b02a94695">
      Theoretically, the messy buffer is supposed to function as a temporary holding area, a place to stash the incoming deluge of bits for future digestion. The neat version of my notes form the “archival version,” if you will—the copy I plan to reference years to come, when I need to page an idea back into memory.
      <div class="children"></div>
    </div>
<div class="text" id="b821d0eb1">
      Yet I’ve often found myself returning to the messy notes, even years later<em>,</em> over their neatly typeset counterparts. Something about the multicolor chaos and scribbles carries additional information that’s lost in the transition to <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mtext>TeX</mtext></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\TeX</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.89883em;vertical-align:-0.2155em;"></span><span class="mord text"><span class="mord textrm">T</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:-0.1667em;"></span><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.46782999999999997em;"><span style="top:-2.7845em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:3em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord textrm">E</span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.2155em;"><span></span></span></span></span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:-0.125em;"></span><span class="mord textrm">X</span></span></span></span></span>. With the latter, I end up heavily exercising my (grossly overtaxed) reading comprehension muscles in order to deserialize all those perfect symbols and prose back into something my brain can actually manipulate. By comparison, the messy version feels closer to my brain’s native representation.

      In this regard, typesetting my notes often serves as more of a finger exercise or summative assessment than an inherently-productive milestone. This was not always obvious to me! In my area of computer science, there’s a certain unspoken assumption that ideas aren’t “official” until they are properly typeset. (True maestros develop <a href="https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/">incredibly impressive</a> setups for live note-taking in <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mtext>LaTeX</mtext></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\LaTeX</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.89883em;vertical-align:-0.2155em;"></span><span class="mord text"><span class="mord textrm">L</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:-0.36em;"></span><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.68333em;"><span style="top:-2.904999em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord textrm mtight sizing reset-size6 size3">A</span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:-0.15em;"></span><span class="mord text"><span class="mord textrm">T</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:-0.1667em;"></span><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.46782999999999997em;"><span style="top:-2.7845em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:3em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord textrm">E</span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.2155em;"><span></span></span></span></span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:-0.125em;"></span><span class="mord textrm">X</span></span></span></span></span></span>; I remain in awe of their prowess.) For a long time I bought into the idea that a beautifully typeset PDF was the apogee of knowledge production. But increasingly I find myself referencing my scribbles instead, where seemingly all the information content lies in the marginalia.

      Realization #2: I know a lot of things I haven’t consciously digested
    </h3>
<div class="text" id="b721a22b6">
      One might think that ingestion is meaningless on its own, per the aphorism “in one ear and out the other.” Yet when I reflect on my own learning, the <strong>overwhelming majority of concepts never reach digestion</strong>. To be sure, I always <em>tell</em> myself (and others!) I’m going to take another slow pass through the chapter and re-watch all the lectures, but this is the intellectual equivalent of buying a gym membership on January 1. The problem isn’t even motivation—I almost always have a strong intrinsic desire to properly learn the material in question, but in reality I have the executive function of a pigeon who has suffered a non-lethal window crash, and so inevitably all my best-laid intentions get pushed further and further down the docket until they fall away to fester in some accursed cognitive parking lot that will never bear witness to the lights of new urbanism (dense, walkable, interconnected conceptual schema).
      <div class="children"></div>
    </div>
<div class="text" id="b05178380">
      And yet, from this suburban graveyard, this veritable chop-shop of bicycles for the mind, a heartening paradox arises: <strong>I somehow know a lot more than I think I do</strong><em>.</em> 
      <div class="children"></div>
    </div>
<div class="text" id="b180e9952">
      I’d guess that I properly digest at most 1%, probably much closer to 0.1%, of all the information I encounter and consider interesting/desirable knowledge. By my own self-assessment, I can only claim to “know” that 0.1-1%. But somehow I feel like my percentage of “useful” knowledge—transferrable ideas, not just memorized definitions—is much closer to 5%, perhaps? Within that delta lies all of the concepts that piqued my interest at some point, that I swore I’d study but never did, but that I somehow find myself incorporating fluidly months or years later, in a way that passes expert scrutiny (modulo terminology).
      <div class="children"></div>
    </div>
<div class="text" id="bf43a6d38">
      Examples off the top of my head: the transitive closure of a binary relation, deforestation in programming languages, matroids as a generalization of linear independence, how to skate a one-foot glide on ice. All of these were concepts I encountered at some point and never properly absorbed (for lack of time or attention), until one day I invoked the concept without thinking very hard, and realized I understood it well enough to perform near (or far!) transfer.
      <div class="children"></div>
    </div>
<div class="text" id="b28fed672">
      There’s also a distinct, but related version of this “passive learning” phenomenon, which I frequently experience as follows: 
      <div class="children"></div>
    </div>
<ol id="b0f2b093a"><li id="b7dc6d55a">
      <div class="list-item">
        I’m in a seminar, and someone introduces a concept. It sounds interesting, so I make a note to go over it later, and follow the rest of the talk at the level of vibes only. 
      </div>
      
    </li>
<li id="b7bd3e279">
      <div class="list-item">
        Surprising no one, I do not end up going back over the concept; if you ask me to explain it three months later, I will tell you “I meant to look into this after watching a talk but I never got around to it so I really don’t know.”
      </div>
      
    </li>
<li id="b41600029">
      <div class="list-item">
        Two months later, someone will reference the concept in an unrelated conversation, and I’ll instantly feel a sense of greater intellectual familiarity and comfort than would ever be rationally merited. (Often this “familiarity buff” causes me to retain more of the second conversation, catalyzing a positive feedback loop in my overall learning trajectory.) 
      </div>
      
    </li></ol>
<div class="text" id="ba45ad6a3">
      This particular mashup of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mere-exposure_effect">mere exposure</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_illusion">Baader–Meinhof</a> is not quite as potent as the preceding examples insofar as it’s mostly limited to recognition instead of recall, but I’ve found that lots of people have experienced a similar phenomenon, making it a useful reference point when describing the surprising effectiveness of messy or superficial learning.
      <div class="children"></div>
    </div>
<div class="text" id="b6c246fe8">
      Though it speaks more to the extent of my neuroticism than anything else, the following unintuitive realization has provided me with untold succor:
      <div class="children"></div>
    </div>
<blockquote>
      <p><em>I am capable of integrating serious knowledge without a formal “digestive” phase.</em></p>
      
    </blockquote>
<div class="text" id="b9dca61b5">
      I used to believe that if I never made the time to properly work through a concept, all of that knowledge was lost to me approximately forever. Repeatedly failing to marshal the time and focus for “deep study” made me feel terrible, as if I were wasting or spurning the very insights I’d professed to desire! By contrast, it provides immense comfort to know there’s some background process in my head, diligently working to incorporate disjointed syntax into something with robust meaning. Specifically, this realization has made me (1) way less panicky about missing out on information, because I have faith it will re-emerge when the time is right, and (2) much more appreciative of my brain doing its best, even when I’m deeply frustrated with my own cognitive limitations.

      Ok so?
    </h2>
<div class="text" id="b3a3fb9f5">
      Increasingly I’ve come to recognize that <strong>messy thought serves not only as preparation for neat thought, but has learning value unto itself</strong> for me, and neat thought processes—while satisfying—are not always a prerequisite for proper understanding. For me, this implies the the following corollaries:
      <div class="children"></div>
    </div>
<ul id="b602bbfcf"><li id="bb0fcff08">
      <div class="list-item">
        If someone asks for help understanding a parked concept, or if I re-encounter something in my own exploration, I shouldn’t immediately retreat simply because I haven’t had time to digest the prerequisites. It’s important to communicate my uncertainty and lack of expertise, particularly with collaborators, but I can try to make sense of things anyway; often this yields more fruit than my dessicated hopes might expect.
      </div>
      
    </li>
<li id="b51d8d71e">
      <div class="list-item">
        At any point in time, I know more than I think I do. For example, I probably could not formally define a planar graph without stopping to think (assuming “the edges don’t have to cross!” doesn’t count), but I certainly have enough intuition for the associated applications and encodings to be useful in my own original thought. This has been a fairly persuasive (though not foolproof) rejoinder to my self-inflicted impostor syndrome.

      <em>This is the first of hopefully multiple posts describing how I’ve experienced my brain change throughout my late twenties. Around the time I turned 26, I started to feel like I was getting dumber. Needless to say, this precipitated many a panicked Google search about “mid 20s declining neuroplasticity” and so forth. As I’ve gained more life experience, I’ve recontextualized a lot of these changes in more value-neutral terms, while also realizing they are more descriptively interesting than mere “cognitive decline.” I remember wishing other people had written more about their personal experiences figuring out their brains, so here’s mine.</em>

      My flute teacher always joked that I was “never at a loss for words.” In college, my first-year advisor urged me to declare an English major after reading my papers. When I was contemplating the possibility of repeating tenth grade, my dismal adolescent self-worth was held together by effusive encouragement from a handful of debate coaches who believed I had talent, the first affirmation I’d received from any high school educator.
      <div class="children"></div>

      Since I was a child, people have generally read me as a heavily verbal, cerebral person: it turns out that if you speak quickly enough, with a sufficiently diverse vocabulary, and have not-insipid things to say, observers will conclude that you must be operating some kind of robot brain with great command of language. Often, communicative precision gets mistaken for rationality: therapists routinely worry I am overintellectualizing problems, coworkers tap me for a dispassionate perspective, one of my clinical evaluations describes my “limited affective range.” Unsurprisingly, I accepted and identified with all of these labels from a young age, and all of my metacognitive reflections tacitly assumed my own preference for cerebral, verbal processing modalities.
      <div class="children"></div>
    </div><hr /><div class="text" id="b29a93c44">
      As I get older, I am starting to realize these typologies do not really describe my grown-up thought process. Even calling it a “thought process” feels premature, since it more closely resembles some kind of deeply-embodied fountain of feeling-thought-plasma than any kind of structured internal monologue. Whenever I talk to people, or read a paper, or form judgments of any kind, the fountain immediately starts spewing feeling-thought-plasma everywhere, and it’s up to me to capture some volume before it all condenses back into recirculation (here I am presuming a great deal about how both fountains and plasma work). But even if I manage to grab some of the plasma, it’s nowhere close to the kind of “solid” matter that I could present to another party for consideration. I am not impugning the clarity of my ideas, or their degree of comprehensibility/refinement. I mean that I quite literally have no clue how to turn this fully-formed congealment of thoughts and feelings into any medium with a measurable information content.
      <div class="children"></div>
    </div><div class="text" id="b29a93c44">
      I don’t know how this works for everyone else, so here’s an example: suppose I’m engaged in a back-and-forth with a knowledgeable interlocutor on a reasonably nuanced topic, say, <a href="https://slim.computer/assets/teaching/baseball.pdf">baseball</a> or the desired behavior of a particular programming language construct or why a particular person we both know behaves the way they do. Or suppose I’m reading a blog post that lays out a multifaceted argument in favor of some proposal. As soon as I understand what the person is saying (which is very much not a given), an entire response—at once enthusiastic partial agreement, hesitant elaboration, and multi-subpoint refutation framed by indignation—materializes all at once within my body in pre-linguistic form, and I feel overwhelmed trying to even capture it for myself, let alone convey it to another party. In practice, this usually manifests as me staring into space while speaking comically slowly, or stammering and replacing words with noises which, in my head, capture the underlying emotion and therefore both denotation and connotation, but to everyone else just sound like a person pretending to be a bird. A far cry from the supposedly “articulate” communication my teachers once commended!
      <div class="children"></div>
    </div><hr /><div class="text" id="b29a93c44">
      I want to be clear that I’m not trying to describe my experience as “word brain atrophied and this ruined everything.” Instead, I am trying to capture a more qualitative shift in how I think, or at least my awareness of how I think, from “mostly verbal” to “mostly pre-linguistic and actually quite demanding to render linguistic.” It’s been neither strictly positive nor negative: when I am working through concepts in my own head, with no arrears to legibility, I really enjoy the sense of fluidity conferred by the pre-linguistic phase. My brain moves fast. I still get stuck quite a bit, but generally due to valid misconceptions or the inherent difficulty of the material, rather than the viscosity of the medium.
      <div class="children"></div>
    </div><div class="text" id="b29b93c44">
      On the other hand, there are a lot of functional challenges with this style of thinking. Since each thought is fully-formed, complex, and (dis)appears at the slightest perturbation or within milliseconds, whichever is sooner, it’s impossible to process without sacrificing enormous nuance and/or dropping the last 30-70% of the thought entirely. (I once spoke on a panel answering various questions about early-career decisionmaking. Afterwards, one student approached me to ask why I always numbered my answers into two distinct points. I hadn’t noticed this at all, but eventually realized that the numbering was a desperate attempt to preserve the structure of my response as it originally materialized, while stopping at two reflected my inability to remember anything past that.) Moreover, oftentimes the thought in its primitive form is so structurally convoluted that simply taking the first 30% yields something completely unintelligible, not just a sentence fragment but closer to a malformed tree. Now I’ve lost the train before it has even left the station, but the original thought in all its richness tantalizes me from the aether, and it becomes an obsession like a word on the tip of your tongue—a relentless fixation, a source of near-dysphoria.
      <div class="children"></div>
    </div><div class="text" id="b29a93c44">
      Speaking of emotions, they’re really hard to disentangle from the “thoughts,” to the extent such a separation is even possible. For better or worse, I tend to experience both positive and negative emotions much more intensely than others I’ve asked. Here, the intensity plays a critical function: it’s hard to translate thoughts into words, but easier to translate into <em>feelings</em>, which are certainly easier to remember thereafter. Unfortunately, if I only retain the feelings but not the constitutive thoughts, I wind up frustrated, grasping at a sense of loss, and mildly embarrassed about how strongly I feel without any explanation (even for myself)—and, naturally, unable to explain any of this to the person I’m speaking to :)
      <div class="children"></div>
    </div><div class="text" id="b29a93c44">
      All of this presents surprising difficulty when participating in conversations (especially, counterintuitively, when I have relevant expertise), explaining a complex social dynamic, or even answering the question “how have you been?” which is the easiest way to stunlock me. In fact, this kind of overwhelmed inability to verbalize—and I mean this in a general sense, not just “vocalize” or “write” but to formulate using language—has increasingly become the norm since I graduated college, which is why I rarely blog or write threads or answer other people’s questions even when I’ve spent inordinate time pondering them. I really rue this, because I know it limits my ability to contribute in the way I’d like: as a researcher, specialist overthinker, and general digitally-mediated quasi-recluse. I <em>want</em> to see the internet as a borderless platform for the dissemination and exchange of conceptual richness. Instead, I mostly produce 160-character shitposts.
      <div class="children"></div>
    </div><div class="text" id="b29a93c44">
      Oddly, when push comes to shove, I can still produce quite decent writing in both scientific and more ornate (“English major-y”) styles, and every now and again someone will remark on the eloquence of some in-person contribution of mine. I haven’t completely lost my tongue, to the assured chagrin of my haters. But more and more, I spend the bulk of my waking hours consumed by ideas, tickled by and gallivanting in their magnificence, then struggling to externalize them. Even this blog post took ages to write, despite consisting exclusively of navel-gazing that I’ve had ample time to contemplate over the years.
      <div class="children"></div>
    </div><div class="text" id="b29a93c44">
      A few miscellaneous concluding observations:

      <div class="list-item">
        Recency bias is always possible, but I definitely think this phenomenon has become more pronounced over time. I can’t tell whether it’s because my command of language is eroding (making it harder to shape the slurry of instincts, feelings, and plasma into something cogent), my thoughts have simply become more complex as I grow up and learn more about the world, or a combination of both.
      </div>
      
    </li>
<li id="b29a93c44">
      <div class="list-item">
        Rehearsal (not necessarily speaking, just mental verbalization of ideas) drastically mitigates the problem, so my oral presentations are generally unaffected, while casual conversations are tactically nuked. Between these two mediums, I’m actually not sure which one I’d rather retain.
      </div>
      
    </li>
<li id="b29a93c44">
      <div class="list-item">
        Novel thoughts produce exponentially more verbal hesitation. So, affective frustration notwithstanding, it’s actually a good sign for <em>me</em> if I’m finding myself frequently at a loss for words—it means the conversation is pushing me to enunciate ideas I don’t have a lot of practice enunciating! Typically this means I’m formulating new ideas or thinking about something I hadn’t heretofore considered. Of course, this is a one-sided view, because my lack of responsiveness is probably much worse for my conversational partner.

        I think the “plasma fountain” style of cognition is a big part of why I get along with mathematicians, despite my own paltry background. Moreso than other disciplines I’ve encountered, mathematics has a distinctly vibes-driven terroir, and everyone implicitly knows this. So I don’t have to spend time re-explaining myself, and generally there’s much less of an impedance mismatch.
